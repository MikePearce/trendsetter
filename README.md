## Trendsetter

Sometimes, you just want more stats.

This app uses the Easybacklog API to pull in stats about your sprints, stories, estimates and other stuff.

You'll need to edit src/MikePearce/EasybacklogApiBundle/Resources/config/services.yml and add your easybacklog API key and user id (both found on https://www.easybacklog.com/api when you're logged in)
